# Card'O'Matic - name and logo suggestions are welcome

The project is a simple card based learning application, utilizing ChatGPT text completion.
The idea came from spaced repetition learning and the fact that I'm usually too lazy to write the cards myself.
So I started typing and Card'O'Matic was born. It can throw a couple of questions at you based on a topic you define.

My goal with this project was to have a little fun with the ChatGPT API and code a little.
The project uses Chakra UI as I was also curious about it, but I might have gone overboard with that as the whole UI is very simple.

## How to play?

1. First of all you'll need a Open AI API key to play (at least for now)
2. Clone the project
3. Run `npm install`
4. Add the API key to the `openai` config
5. Run `npm run dev`
6. Have fun!

## Known issues
